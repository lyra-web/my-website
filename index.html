      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Gender equality</strong> means giving everyone—regardless of gender—equal rights,
         respect, and opportunities in all areas of life. It’s about ensuring that 
         women, men, and all gender identities have the freedom to learn, work, and
          lead without discrimination. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Promoting gender equality helps create 
        a fairer and more inclusive society where everyone’s voice matters.
